### **Abstract**

<hr>

Indian Farmers contributes to nearly one third of India GDP. It provides livelihood for the major Indian population. Some of the challenges they faces are old, some are new. Government must give farmers the same importance as industries. If the proper care won't be taken, the words like "small farmer" will become a history.

The problems of Indian farmers are even bigger than what government anticipates.Rural marketing is a vast and developing area and when its comes to exploring rural market, it has a great future possibility to expandthe market . FMCG sector in India is the fourth largest in the economy & none of the FMCG companies would like to miss this
opportunity, it gives an immense growth possibilities. Characteristics like low income ,illiteracy , heterogeneity ,scattered population are
making it a bit unattractive but still it has a huge scope of penetration as government are now launching various schemes to uplift the rural
India to get them pace with the current scenario of technological advancement.Thereby Our Prodcut Voice4Rural Trues To Bridge This Gap Between Rural People.
<br>
Looking at the current market conditions, we thought that it was the right time to develop some solutions in which we can break this loop.


### **The Problem**

<hr>

  -  Starting the covid vaccination drive in rural areas is a problem and spreading an awareness about vaccines.
  -  Starting their own business is often troublesome due to lack of buyers.
  -  Finding new jobs in the city is often a tedious task for rural people.
  -  Latest news from the national leaders or what’s actually going on around never reaches the rural people.
  -  Misinformation often results in false news which spread arounds like wildfire.
  -  Exact changes in prices of commodities, sensex, petrol, diesel, gold, isn’t known and this often keeps the farmer at a loss.
  -  Turbulent weather or sudden changes proves to be quite harmful for the crops and even worse for the farmers.
  -  Most of the issues an individual faces goes unheard or unattended



### **The Solution**

<hr>

- Connect people to nearby vaccination centres to book their places from the available booking slots.
- Connecting with buyers to facilitate selling of handmade products made by the village people to make use of their self-learned skills and make some money.
- Collect various job recommendations that have been posted in various social platforms and bringing them under a single roof that matches the profile of the user.
- Scraping information from twitter about changes in policy or any existing setups. Also displaying news of deemed importance from ministry or any national authority.
- Providing hourly updates about changes/fluctuations in the prices of crops.

### **Features :**

<hr>

- Native Multilingual Support so that User Can use this app with their own native language hassle-free
- Booking done in the nearest hospital on basis of available slots.  A simple setup to assist people who aren’t much familiar with technology.
- Another easy to use setup to post the handmade-items along with the negotiable price and the contact details. This will be a really good step up in turning India atmanirbhar and will also in turn help the needy.
- Matching jobs based on the user profile and giving updates based on that. Almost everyone in villages are looking for jobs and this would surely help them in the run.
- Apart from newspapers, news from social media isn’t accessible by majority of the rural people. Instead of showing all, if we display messages based on their interests/any major announcements that would surely help the people.
- The middle men often take advantage of the farmer’s/rural people’s inability to catch up with the latest fluctuations in price, this keeps the farmers at a loss. Hence with proper hourly updates displayed in our webapp, it won’t stand a problem anymore.
- Crop Yield Production Prediction So that Farmer Can Invest Time and Money Accordingly
- Full Crop Profile Details Retrieval so that Farmers Can have full access to details of crops - Like Exporting Countries , Major Price in states and so on
- Foecasted Prediction of Crop Prices So that Farmers can have certain estimation about which crop would be more beneficial to grow and invest.



### **Unique Selling Point**

<hr>

- A smartphone and internet is all you need. This is something everyone has these days.
- This is a big step up towards Atmanirbhar Bharat where Indians can use their own traditional handcrafts instead of relying on foreign products.
- Perfect opportunity for rural men and especially women to uplift themselves using these skills and get a job.
- Due to rumours and fake news, riot breakouts are quite common among villagers. Our news scraped directly from trusted sources like twitter would definitely be able to prevent this to a large extent.
- Our web app would actually be a big step up in voicing out the issues faced by villagers, which mostly go unheard all the time.
